<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This guide walks you through the main steps required to add Blox Material to
  new or existing Angular projects. It assumes the use of
  <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a> for creating and maintaining your
  project. The guide also assumes that you are running at least node 6.9.x and
  npm 3.x.x, which you can verify by running <code>node -v</code> and <code>npm -v</code>.
  Please refer to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node Downloads</a>
  for instructions to install node and npm on your computer.
</p>
<p>To install Angular CLI, run:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install -g @angular/cli'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will install the <code>ng</code> command globally on your system.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare your Angular Project</h2>
<p>Although not required, using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is highly recommended with
  Blox Material projects. The Material styling/themes are that much easier to customize with Sass.
</p>
<p>For new projects, just use Angular CLI to bootstrap the project, and make scss (Sass) the default
  stylesheet preprocessor:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'ng new NAME-OF-PROJECT --style=scss\ncd NAME-OF-PROJECT'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>For existing projects that not yet use Sass, you can switch to Sass as default stylesheet preprocessor
  with the following command (run inside the root directory of your project):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'ng set defaults.styleExt scss'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then simply rename <code>src/styles.css</code> to <code>src/styles.scss</code>, and in the configuration file
<code>.angular-cli.json</code> also change the reference to <code>styles.css</code> to refer to
<code>styles.scss</code> instead. (You can find that under apps/styles in the file).
Since scss is an extension of css, this will not affect your existing styles.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Install Blox Material</h2>
<p>Now add the Blox Material library to your project:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save @blox/material'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next install <code>@angular/forms</code> (optional):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save @angular/forms'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>And add the Material module to your application (in <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="codeModule" [language]="'typescript'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  The example also includes the <code>@angular/forms FormsModule</code>. Using the FormsModule
  is <strong>not</strong> a requirement of Blox Material. All Material directives can also be used
  without the FormsModule. However, the FormsModule makes building forms much easier, with easy
  binding of controls to data, addition of validation rules, display of errors, and much more.
  Please refer to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/forms">Angular Forms Guide</a> for more in
  depth information.</p>
<blockquote>
  Blox Material is fully compatible with <code>@angular/forms</code>, and support both the
  <code>FormsModule</code>, and the
  <code><a href="https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code>.
  But all of the Blox Material directives can also be used without the <code>@angular/forms</code>
  package.
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 3: Import and Customize a Theme</h2>
<p>To make the Sass preprocessor find all Material Components theme files, add the following configuration
  to the <code>apps</code> section of the <code>.angular.cli.json</code> file:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="cliIncludeThemes" [language]="'json'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, add the following code to your <code>src/styles.scss</code> file:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="codeScss" [language]="'scss'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>For more information about customizing and extending the theme, see
  <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-theme">Material
    Components Web Theme Documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Add Material Directives</h2>
<p>Open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and add some markup, for example:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [language]="'html'"
    [source]="'&lt;button mdcButton mdcRaised&gt;My First Material Button&lt;/button&gt;'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, run <code>npm run start</code> to run your application, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>,
and validate you get a nice button styled according to the Material Guidelines.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have made your first Angular App with Blox Material!
Now check the <a [routerLink]="['/directives']">Directives</a> section of this website for code samples
of other Material components.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Although you now have a web application that works with Blox Material, there are still two issues to tackle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you open the application in a browser that doesn't support a reasonable subset of the latest
      javascript (es2015) features (such as IE11), the application will bail, because of javascript parsing errors.
    </li>
    <li>A production build of the application (using <code>ng build --prod</code>) will also fail with javascript build errors.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both issues have the same cause: Blox Material depends on Google's Material Components for the Web, which is
    distributed in different <code>@material/*</code> npm packages.
    These packages all use es2015 (also called es6, or ecmascript 2015) features that not all browsers support.
    Angular CLI also doesn't support minifying es2015, which explains why a production build fails.</p>
  <p>
    We have written a separate guide to tackle just this problem:
    <a [routerLink]="['/guides','ng-transpile']">Using es2015 javascript packages with Angular CLI</a>.
