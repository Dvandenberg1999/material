<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This guide walks you through adding Blox Material to
  new or existing Angular projects. It assumes the use of
  <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a> for creating and maintaining your
  project. The guide also assumes that you are running at least node 6.9.x and
  npm 3.x.x, which you can verify by running <code>node -v</code> and <code>npm -v</code>.
  Please refer to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node Downloads</a>
  for instructions to install node and npm on your computer. To install Angular CLI, run:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install -g @angular/cli'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will install the <code>ng</code> command globally on your system.
If Angular CLI is already installed on your system, make sure you have at least
version 1.5.2 installed, by running <code>ng -v</code>.
To upgrade to the latest version just run the install command shown above again.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare your Angular Project</h2>
<p>Although not required, using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is highly recommended with
  Blox Material projects. The Material styling/themes are much easier to customize with Sass. For new
  projects, use Angular CLI to bootstrap the project, and make scss (Sass) the default stylesheet
  preprocessor:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'ng new NAME-OF-PROJECT --style=scss\ncd NAME-OF-PROJECT'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>For existing projects that do not use Sass yet, you can switch to Sass as default stylesheet preprocessor
  with the following command (run inside the root directory of your project):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'ng set defaults.styleExt scss'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then simply rename <code>src/styles.css</code> to <code>src/styles.scss</code>, and in the configuration file
<code>.angular-cli.json</code> also change the reference to <code>styles.css</code> to refer to
<code>styles.scss</code> instead. (You can find that under apps/styles in the file).
Since scss is an extension of css, this will not affect your existing styles.</p>
<p>For existing projects, also make sure that you are using at least Angular CLI 1.5.2
(Angular CLI uses the version installed for your project, not the globally installed
version). This can be checked by running <code>ng -v</code> in the project directory.
If the project uses an older Angular CLI version, upgrade it by running
<code>npm install --save-dev @angular/cli</code> in your project directory.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Install Blox Material</h2>
<p>Now add the Blox Material library to your project:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save @blox/material'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next install <code>@angular/forms</code> (optional):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save @angular/forms'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>And add the Material module to your application (in <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="codeModule" [language]="'typescript'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  The example also includes the <code>@angular/forms FormsModule</code>. Using the FormsModule
  is <strong>not</strong> a requirement of Blox Material. All Blox Material components can also be used
  without the FormsModule. However, the FormsModule makes building forms much easier, with easy
  binding of controls to data, addition of validation rules, display of errors, and much more.
  Please refer to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/forms">Angular Forms Guide</a> for more in
  depth information.</p>
<blockquote>
  Blox Material is fully compatible with <code>@angular/forms</code>, and supports both the
  <code>FormsModule</code>, and the
  <code><a href="https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code>.
  But all Blox Material features can also be used without the <code>@angular/forms</code>
  package.
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 3: Import and Customize a Theme</h2>
<p>To tell the Sass preprocessor how to find all Material Components theme files,
  add the following configuration to the <code>apps</code> section of the
  <code>.angular.cli.json</code> file:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="cliIncludeThemes" [language]="'json'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, add the following code to your <code>src/styles.scss</code> file:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="codeScss" [language]="'scss'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  This will add theme styles for all available Material components. If you only use
  a couple of components, you can save space by only including the theme files
  for the components you actually use. For example:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [language]="'scss'"
    [source]="'@import &quot;@material/button/mdc-button&quot;;\n@import &quot;@material/card/mdc-fab&quot;;'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>To use Google's Material Icons, and the Roboto font (default font for the Material components),
  you may also want to add the following stylesheets to the head section of the <code>src/index.html</code>
  file (both are optional):
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [language]="'html'" [source]="indexStylesheets"></code></pre>
</div>  
<p>
  For more information about customizing and extending the theme, see
  <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-theme">Material
    Components Web Theme Documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Add Material Components</h2>
<p>Open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and add some markup, for example:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [language]="'html'"
    [source]="'&lt;button mdcButton raised&gt;My First Material Button&lt;/button&gt;'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, run <code>npm run start</code> to run your application, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>,
  and validate you get a nice button styled according to the Material Guidelines. Congratulations,
  you have made your first Angular App with Blox Material! The <a [routerLink]="['/components']">Components</a>
  section of this website contains documentation and code samples for all supported Material components.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Compatibility with older browsers</h2>
<p>The web app you just created will not work with older browsers, such as IE11.
  Blox Material depends on Google's Material Components for the Web, which is
  distributed in different <code>@material/*</code> npm packages.
  These packages all use es2015 (also called es6, or ecmascript 2015) features that
  not all browsers support. Here we show one way to solve this issue, while
  still being able to use Angular CLI to manage your project.
  First you need to install a utility to postprocess the javascript and html
  generated by the build, and transpile the javascript to es5 code:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save-dev @blox/ng-utils'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Now open your <code>package.json</code> and edit your scripts section to customize the <code>start</code>
  and <code>build</code> scripts, and add a <code>transpile</code> script:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="pkgTasks" [language]="'json'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Next add polyfills for features that some browsers not yet support natively: Angular CLI has created a
  <code>src/polyfills.ts</code> file for supporting older browsers, but by default it
  has commented out all polyfills required for Internet Explorer. So to support Internet Explorer,
  remove the comments at the start of the file. This will make it look like:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="tsPolyfills" [language]="'typescript'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Also, as instructed for the <code>classlist.js</code> polyfill, run:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save classlist.js'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>From now on make sure to always use the following command to create a production distribution of your
  application (instead of <code>ng build --prod</code>):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm run build'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Congratulations! You now have your Angular application fully integrated with Blox Material, optimized and working for
  any browser supported by Angular.
  Now head to the <a [routerLink]="['/components']">components documentation</a> for code samples and instructions on
  how to use all Material components in your app!
